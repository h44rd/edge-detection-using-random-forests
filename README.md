### Running the code:
 The code is run as follows "python main.py"
 
 The input images are to be placed in the directory "./input/images/test/"
 
 The output images will be saved to the directory "./edges/"
 
### Training:
The model is to be trained using the full dataset available at the following link:
<http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/BSR/BSR_bsds500.tgz>

The dataset is to be placed in the "input" directory

Once the training is over, the model will be saved to "./model/forests/"

Currently only a part of the dataset is in the repository, due to space constraints

### Examples:

Some of the outputs obtained when the model was trained on the full dataset is given in the "./examples" directory, where the inputs and corresponding outputs are in the directories "./examples/input" and "./examples/output" respectively.
